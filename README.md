- 👋 Hi, I’m @tsunami-dev
- 👀 I’m interested in Becoming a developer that helps advance the way use Technology in todays mondern age because as a kid I've always thought about how there is so many ways that a thought can turn into an actual applications that help not only help people but as i said advance the way we use our technology.
- another part of the reason why i decided to get into tech was my love for understanding how things work when it comes to electronics is i would personally say i've alaways dreamed of geting into tech but didnt know how to start. my experience with coding and development is still fairly new as i've only completed two major projects and am currently working on my third as we speak. beyond that i also want to use this drive to be in tech to help support my family.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Big Data_Haddop, Apache Spark, Hive, Scala, mySQL/SparkSQL 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all forms of data entry as well as building towards fullstack
